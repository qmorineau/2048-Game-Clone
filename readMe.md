# 2048 Game Clone

## Overview

This project is a clone of the popular 2048 game implemented using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game continues until the player achieves this goal or the grid is full.

## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qmorineau/2048-game-clone.git

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## Game Controls

Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move tiles in the corresponding direction.
Press the R key to restart the game.

## Gameplay

1. Objective:
Combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048.

2. Tile Movement:

Use the arrow keys to move tiles in the desired direction.
Tiles will move as far as possible in the chosen direction until they reach the edge or collide with another tile.

3. Combining Tiles:

When two tiles with the same number collide, they combine into a new tile with double the value.
For example, if two tiles with the number 2 collide, they will merge into a single tile with the number 4.

4. Game Over:

The game ends when the player reaches the 2048 tile or when the grid is full, and no more moves are possible.

## Project Purpose
This project serves as a personal exercise to test and improve my logical reasoning using JavaScript. The primary goal is to create a functional clone of the 2048 game, showcasing my ability to implement game mechanics and handle user interactions.

## Future Plans
In subsequent iterations of the project, I plan to explore and implement animations for the tiles. Integrating animations will not only enhance the visual appeal of the game but also provide a valuable opportunity to delve into front-end development techniques, further refining my skills in web development.

Feel free to check back for updates as the project evolves!
